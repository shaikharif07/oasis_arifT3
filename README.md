Project Title
# Car Price Prediction

Description
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various features of cars such as mileage, engine power, and age, along with their corresponding prices. By training and evaluating machine learning models on this data, we can predict the price of a car given its features.

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd car-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Open the car_price_prediction.ipynb notebook.
Execute the cells to run the code and observe the results.
Modify the notebook as needed for further exploration and experimentation.

Data
The dataset used in this project is available in the data directory. It contains information about various cars, including features like mileage, engine power, and age, along with their corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in a CSV format (cars.csv).

Models
Two machine learning models were utilized for car price prediction:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
The code for both models can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The evaluation results for each model are mentioned in the notebook.
